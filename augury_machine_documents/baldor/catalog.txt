Q2 2023 results
To summarize the outcome in the second quarter, I would first highlight the 2% comparable order growth which was up from last year's already high level, and the positive book-to-bill. It was good to see that the customer activity remained robust throughout the period. Secondly, the high revenue growth of 13% (17% comparable) supported by backlog execution. Thirdly, the record-high achievements on both absolute Operational EBITA of $1.4 billion and Operational EBITA margin of 17.5%, up 200 basis points from last year, with all four business areas above 15%. This was supported by a strong price contribution which more than offset labor inflation as well as some limited cost inflation related to commodities, with additional support from operational leverage on increased volumes in production. And lastly, the solid cash flow from operating activities of $760 million. All the while we executed on portfolio optimization and continued to introduce leading new technology to help our customers become more sustainable and resource efficient. In my view, the quarter is an additional indication that we are establishing ABB's operational performance at a higher level.



Parker and ABB take an inflatable boat to the top of the world
The Northwest Passage is the sea route between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans through the Arctic Ocean, along the northern coast of North America. This 6,000-kilometer stretch of treacherous waters is considered one of the most dangerous nautical routes in the world. For centuries, explorers sought a navigable passage as a possible trade route to Asia but were blocked by North, Central, and South America; however, in 1906, a team of Norwegian sailors successfully traversed the passage. Since then, specialty vessels with crews of dozens, if not hundreds, of highly trained sailors have attempted the voyage; some emerged successfully on the other side, but just as many were forced to turn back, call for rescue – or worse.



ABB to invest $1 million in advanced manufacturing workforce initiative | Press release
ABB announced today at the SelectUSA Investment Summit that it is investing $1 million in the University of Arkansas - Fort Smith (UAFS) to help position the school to become one of the nation’s leading advanced manufacturing educational institutions. This announcement follows ABB’s recent commitment to invest $170 million in manufacturing and distribution operations in 2023.

Designs and construction features of marine motors
Commercial marine motors in general are high-grade motors treated for corrosion resistance and designed for use on shipboard applications. These motors meet the regulatory requirements governed by three major specifications: the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) Rules for Building and Classing Marine Vessels1, the United States Coast Guard (USCG) Electrical Engineering Regulations2 and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Standard 45, Recommended Practice for Electric Installations on Shipboard3. Marine motors are also used for other-than-shipboard service in functions on offshore drilling rigs, shipyard applications and port equipment. Marine motors are usually mounted to steel structures, which are subject to vibration and shock or pitch and roll movement, and typical marine application settings are very humid and salt-laden harsh environments. Therefore, the environments in which shipboard motors operate and the functions they perform require unique design and construction considerations above those of standard industrial motors.



Maximize motor reliability and efficiency | External article
Choosing the right motor and drive for an application is central to achieving the desired performance and service life. Strategic monitoring and testing help to keep the devices and systems in top form. The following are some offerings that further these crucial goals.



Digital technology helps het to the heart of the matter with pumps | External article
Pumps are literally the heart of a food plant, moving vital fluids around. And as with human hearts, electronic monitoring of their condition can ensure continued health. Digital technology has enhanced the performance and the maintenance of many kinds of industrial equipment, and pumps are no exception. The right kind of monitoring and control of pumps, and of the motors and drives that power them, can go a long way toward improving their performance and making sure they keep running.
