GX SERIES
Helical & bevel helical extruders design
Standard and extended centre distance model helical gear reducers and gearmotors equipped with extruder support, derived from the parallel and right-angle shaft standard series with extruder support flange redesigned to have wide support surfaces.
Extruder support conceived for standard and heavy applications. Excellent gear reducer transmitted torque to admissible axial load ratio.

H SERIES
Helical & bevel helical gear reducers
Large size gear reducers produced specifically conceived for granting highest reliability in heaviest application conditions. This series combines and exalts the traditional qualities of helical and bevel helical gear reducers (strength, efficiency, compactness, reliability) with advantages derived from modern design, manufacturing and operating criteria: multiple mounting and application ease, wide size range, service, economy. 

EP SERIES
Planetary gear reducers & gearmotors
The planetary gearboxes are designed with the help of the most advanced technologies, exploiting the experience gained in all the most severe applications. A complete range of gearboxes, suitable for every type of product in the industrial field.
Planetary gearboxes are used in almost all fields of use that require high torques, peak bearing capacity, high transmission ratio, high efficiency and lifetime, small dimensions and weights.

EP KING SERIES
High torque and combined gear reducers & gearmotors
Modular gearboxes for customer tailored solutions where are  required the highest torques, peak bearing capacity, high transmission ratio, high efficiency and lifetime.
A cost-effective and reliable solution for “heavy duty” environment.

EPS SERIES
Planetary Slewing gear reducers & gearmotors
Born from the planetary gearbox experience, slewing drives offer highest output torque in the range from 9 kNm to 400 kNm, high peak bearing capacity. They can benefit of the widest range of features of the planetary gearbox catalogue.
