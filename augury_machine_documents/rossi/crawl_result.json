Decommissioning must be carried out by trained and experienced operators, in compliance with applicable occupational health, safety and environmental protection laws.\nAll gear reducer or gearmotor parts must be disposed of at authorized collection sites for waste treatment, recycling and disposal, according to the regulations in force in the country where the disposal will take place Component Material Cylindrical gears with external (pinions and gearwheels) and internal (planetary gears) toothing Case hardened or through hardened steel Bevel gears Worm gears Shafts Roller bearings Keys Shrink discs and locking rings Drive Unit swing bases Carbon steel Fan covers Steel sheets Fans Aluminum or technopolymers Torque arms Carbon steel or cast iron Gear reducer housings, covers, flanges (input and output type) \u2013 Satellite carrier (planetary gear reducers) Gray or spheroidal cast iron Worm gears: worm wheels Bronze and spheroidal cast iron Seal rings Elastomers and steel O-ring V-ring Protection caps Couplings Elastomers and steel Lubricants EP additive mineral oil Synthetic PAG-based oil (factory supply) Synthetic PAO-based oil Synthetic grease for bearings, gears and seals Cooling coil Copper or aluminum Forced lubrication circuit: pipes and fittings Steel or copper Motor component Material Housing - Endshields - Flanges Aluminum or cast iron Stator Steel and copper Rotor Steel and aluminum Roller bearings Steel Seal rings Elastomer and steel Brake Steel, copper, plastics, elastomers 5 UTD.187.2023.11.00_EN Operating instructions G series 1.1.1 - Disposal of packaging materials The materials that compose the packaging should be disposed of at authorized collection centers, giving preference to separate collection and recycling, according to the legal provisions in force in the country where the disposal will take place; reference should also be made to the information contained on the environmental labeling, if any, on the packaging or available on digital channels (e.g.: APPs, QR codes, websites); Type of packaging Material Wooden cases, pallets, beams, ...\nWooden packaging Cardboard packaging and boxes, cardboard and corrugated paper sheets, curled paper, ...\nPaper and cardboard packaging Plastic packaging, barrier sacks, bubble wraps, performed ...\nPlastic packaging For information on the proper disposal of the gearbox or gearmotor, its components and packing material, or on the nearest authori-zed collection centers for treatment, recycling and disposal, contact your local Rossi subsidiary.\n1.2 - Safety The paragraphs marked with symbols shown below contain dispositions to be strictly respected in order to assure personal safety and to avoid any heavy damages to the machine or to the system. (Electric or mechanical) danger, such as: \u2013 live parts; \u2013 temperature higher than 50 \u00b0C; \u2013 components rotating during operation; \u2013 suspended loads (lifting and transport); \u2013 eventual high sound level ( > 85 dB(A)).\nLifting instructions IMPORTANT: gear reducers and gearmotors supplied by Rossi are partly completed machinery to be incorporated into machinery and should not be commissioned before the machinery in which the components have been incorporated conforms to: \u2013 Machinery directive 2006/42/EC and subsequent updatings; in particular, possible safety guards for shaft ends not being used for eventually accessible fan cover passages (or other) are the Buyer's responsibility; \u2013 \u00abElectromagnetic compatibility (EMC)\u00bb 2004/108/EC and subsequent updatings.\nAttention! It is recommended to pay attention to all instructions of present handbook, all standards concerning correct installation and all existing safety laws. Whenever personal injury or property damage may occur, foresee adequate supplementary protection devices against: \u2212 release or breakage of fastening screws; \u2013 rotation or unthreading of the gear reducer from shaft end of driven machine following to accidental breakage of the reaction arrangement; \u2013 accidental breakage of shaft end of driven machine.\nIf deviations from normal operation occur (temperature increase, unusual noise, etc.) immediately switch off the machine.\nInstallation An incorrect installation, an improper use, the removing or disconnection of protection devices, the lack of inspections and maintenance, improper connections may cause severe personal injury or property damage. Therefore the component must be moved, installed, commissioned, handled, controlled, serviced and re-paired exclusively by responsible quali\ufb01 ed personnel.\nThe qualifi ed personnel must be speci\ufb01 cally instructed and have the experience necessary to recognize and prevent dangers (see table 1.2.1 - Residual dangers) connected to present products avoiding all possibile emergencies.\nGear reducers and gearmotors of present handbook are normally suitable for installations in industrial areas: additional protection measures, if necessary, must be adopted and assured by the personnel responsible for the installation.\nAttention! Components in non-standard design or with special executions or with constructive variations may differ in the details from the ones described here following and may require additional information.\nAttention! For the installation, use and maintenance of the electric motor (standard, brake of non-standard motor) or of the eventual motor variator and/or electric supply device (frequency converter, soft-start etc.), and/ or optional electric devices (e.g.: independent cooling unit, etc.), consult the attached specifi c documentation. If necessary, require it.\n6 Operating instructions G series UTD.187.2023.11.00_EN Maintenance When operating on gear reducer or on components connected to it the machine must be at rest and cold: disconnect motor (including auxiliary equipments) from power supply, gear reducer from load, be sure that safety systems are on against any accidental starting and, if necessary, pre-arrange mechanical locking devices (to be removed before commissioning).\nAttention! During the running the gear reducers could have hot surfaces; always wait that the gear reducer or the gearmotor to cool before carrying out any operations.\nPlease download further technical documentation (e.g.: catalogs) from our website www.rossi-group.com or contact Rossi. For any clarifi cation and/or additional information consult Rossi and specify all name plate data.\nDo not reuse parts or components that have been replaced as a result of maintenance or repair work but which may nevertheless appear to still be intact and fit for use; this could result in a serious loss of product functiona-lity and safety.\n7 UTD.187.2023.11.00_EN Operating instructions G series Tab. 1.2.1 - Residual risks The products supplied by Rossi S.p.A. have been designed and manufactured according to the essential health and safety requirements provided for by the Machine Directive 2006/42/EC - Annex I. The following table lists the residual risks that the user must deal with in compliance with the instructions contained in this document and in those eventually attached to the shipment.\nNature/Cause of Risk Countermeasures Installation and maintenance operations The component must be handled, installed, commissioned, operated, inspected, maintained, and repaired only by qualified, responsible personnel who must carefully read and strictly follow all instructions in this document, including any instructions enclosed with the shipment. They shall also be specifically instructed and have the necessary experience to recognize the hazards and potential hazards (electrical or mechanical) associated with these products, such as, but not limited to: - presence of electrical voltage; - presence of temperature higher than 50 \u00b0C; - presence of moving parts during operation; - presence of suspended loads; - presence of possible high sound level (> 85 dB (A).\nIt must be equipped with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and be familiar with and comply with all applicable regulations regarding proper installation and current safety laws in order to ensure the safety of persons and avoid significant damage to the machine or system.\nFalling or projecting objects For gearboxes equipped with a backstop, provide a protection system against the projection of objects resulting from the breaking of the backstop.\nFor gearboxes fitted with a coupling (fast and/or slow shaft), provide protection against the projection of objects resulting from breakage of the coupling itself.\nFor shaft-mounted gear units, provide appropriate safety devices against - Loosening or breaking of the mounting screws; - Rotation or loosening of the gear unit from the machine pin due to accidental breakage of the reaction constraint; - accidental breakage of the machine pin.\nMovable elements Provide safety guards for unused shaft ends and accessible fan cover passages (or other).\nAny work on the gearbox or gearmotor must be carried out with the machine stopped and disconnected from the power supply and the gearbox or gearmotor cold.\nExtreme Temperatures During operation, the gearboxes may have hot surfaces (> 50 \u00b0C); before starting any operation, always wait for the gearbox or gearmotor to cool down (wait about 1 to 3 hours depending on the size); if necessary, carry out a temperature measurement on the surface of the gearbox or gearmotor near the fast shaft.

Bearing life, good shaft and coupling running depend on alignment precision between the shafts. Carefully align the gear reducer with the motor and the driven machine (with the aid of shims if need be).\nIncorrect alignment may cause breakdown of shafts and/or bearings (which may cause overheatings) which may represent heavy danger for people.\nPosition the gear reducer or gearmotor so as to allow a free passage of air for cooling both gear reducer and motor (especially at motor fan sides).\n\u2013 Avoid any obstruction to the air fl ow; heat sources near the gear reducer that might aff ect the temperature of cooling air and of gear reducer (for radiation); insuffi cient air recycle and applications hindering the steady dissipation of heat; Verify that the gear reducer housing is dust-free in order to achieve an effi cient heat dispersal.\nPlace the supplied adhesive pictogram identifying the risk associated with hot surfaces on the surface of the gear unit in a position visible to personnel involved in machine operation and maintenance.\nMating surfaces (of gear reducer and machine) must be clean and suffi ciently rough to provide a good friction coeffi cient (indicatively Ra 3,2 \u00f7 6,3 \u00b5m). Remove by a scraper or solvent the eventual paint of gear reducer coupling surfaces When external loads are present use pins or locking blocks, if necessary.\nWhen fi tting gear reducer and machine and/or gear reducer and eventual fl ange B5 it is recommended to use locking adhesives such on the fastening screws (also on fl ange mating surfaces).\nFor accessories not suplied by Rossi, pay attention to their dimensioning; consult us, if need be.\nBefore wiring-up the gearmotor make sure that motor voltage corresponds to input voltage. If direction of rotation is not as desired, invert two phases at the terminals.\nY-\u2206 starting should be adopted for no-load starting (or with a very small load) and for smooth starts, low starting current or other similar devices should be fi tted.\nIf overloads are imposed for long periods or if shocks or danger of jamming are envisaged, then motor-protection, electronic torque limiters, fl uid couplings, safety couplings, control units or other similar devices should be fi tted.\nUsually protect the motor with a thermal cut-out however, where duty cycles involve a high number of on-load starts, it is necessari to utilise thermal probes for motor protection (fi tted on the wiring); magnetothermic breaker is unsuitable since its threshold must be set higher than the motor nominal current of rating.\nConnect thermal probes, if any, to auxiliary safety circuits.\nUse varistors and/or RC fi lters to limit voltage peaks due to contactors.\nFor gear reducers equipped with backstop device (see ch. 5.12), foresee a protection system where a backstop device breaking could cause personal injury or property damage.\nWhenever a leakage of lubricant could cause heavy damages, increase the frequency of inspections and/or envisage appropriate control devices (e.g.: remote level gauge, etc.).\nIn polluting surroundings, take suitable precautions against lubricant contamination through seal rings or other.\nFor outdoor installation or in a hostile environment (corrosivity class C3 according to ISO 12944-2) protect the gear reducer or gearmotor with a proper anti-corrosion paint (see ch. 3.4), using water-repellent grease (especially around the rotary seating of seal rings and the accessible zones of shaft end). Gear reducers and gearmotors should be protected whenever possibile and by appropriate means from solar radiation and extremis of weather; weather protection becomes essential when high or low speed shafts are vertically disposed or when the motor is installed vertical with fan uppermost.\nFor ambient temperature greater than +40 \u00b0C or less than 0 \u00b0C, consult Rossi.\nWhen gear reducer or gearmotor is supplied with water cooling by coil or independent cooling unit, see ch. 8.\n13 UTD.187.2023.11.00_EN Operating instructions G series Tab. 5.2.1.

In applications with travelling lifts, the locking bushing is not sufficient to guarantee a stable fitting of hollow low speed shaft with the machine shaft end, also when the axial fastening bolt is fastened with locking adhesive. In these cases, it is necessary to fit with hollow shaft and shrink disc. This is valid, in general, also when there is a high frequency of starting and brakings with motion reversal and when the ratio of inertia J/J0 is very high ( \ue03e 5).\nHelical and bevel helical size 40, 50 Helical and bevel helical size 63 Helical and bevel helical size 64 ... 160 Helical and bevel helical size 180 ... 401 Parallel shaft MR 3I 40, 50 Parallel shaft MR 3I 63 Fig. 5.9.1 Fig 5.9.2 Fig. 5.8.1a Fig. 5.8.1b Fig. 5.8.2 Gear red. size 40 50 63 64 80 81 100 125 140 160 180 200 225 250 280 320, 321 360 400, 401 Bolts for axial fastening UNI 5737-88 cl 8.8 M81) M81) M101) M10 M102) M102) M122) M142) M16 M20 M202) M24 M242) M30 M302) M36 M363) M30 Ms [N m] for rings or bushing 29 35 43 43 51 53 92 170 210 340 430 660 830 1350 1660 2570 3150 -18 Operating instructions G series UTD.187.2023.11.00_EN 5.10 - Mounting of Hollow low speed shaft with shrink disc Shrink disc machine opposite side Shrink disc machine side Shrink disc machine side (sizes 40 ... 125) Shrink disc machine opposite side (sizes 140 ... 401) Shrink disc machine side (sizes 140 ... 401 ) Fig. 5.10.1 Fig. 5.10.2 Fig. 5.10.3 Tab. 5.10.1 - Hollow low speed shaft and machine shaft end with shrink disc 3) Gear reducer size D D2 d E E1 E2 F MS Q \u00d8 \u00d8 UNI 5737-88 cl. 10.9 N m H7 H7 1) 1) 2) 40 20 \u2013 24 99,5 \u2013 65 \u2013 25 \u2013 M5 n. 6 4 \u2013 50 25 \u2013 30 116,5 \u2013 77 \u2013 30 \u2013 M5 n. 7 4 \u2013 63 30 \u2013 38 135,5 \u2013 86 \u2013 34 \u2013 M6 n. 5 12 \u2013 64 35 \u2013 44 140 \u2013 86 \u2013 36 \u2013 M6 n. 7 12 \u2013 80, 81 40 \u2013 50 166 \u2013 103 \u2013 39,5 \u2013 M6 n. 8 12 \u2013 100 50 \u2013 62 197 \u2013 122 \u2013 46,5 \u2013 M8 n. 6 30 \u2013 125 65 \u2013 80 239 \u2013 148 \u2013 55 \u2013 M8 n. 8 30 \u2013 140 70 75 90 273 294,5 180 192,5 52 52 M8 n. 10 30 27,5 160 80 85 105 307 329 199 208 62 57 M10 n. 9 60 29 180 90 100 120 335 363 221 228 65 63 M10 n. 12 60 35 200 100 110 130 377 402 251 260 72 66 M12 n. 10 100 33,5 225 110 120 140 404 428 265 277 78 75 M12 n. 12 100 32,5 250 125 135 160 461 493 307 318 86 84 M16 n. 8 250 45 280 140 150 180 506 543 324 337 104 94 M16 n. 10 250 47 320, 321 160 170 200 567 607 375 388 104 107 M16 n. 12 250 50 360 180 195 230 621 668 400 414 124 116 M16 n. 15 250 57 400, 401 210 220 260 754 788 446 480 1654) 1654) M20 n. 14 490 47 1) \u0007 Values valid for shrink disc on machine opposite side.\n2) \u0007 Bolt tightening torque.\n3) For design with labyrinth seals at low speed shaft, the dimensions E, E1, E2 are changing: please consult us.\n19 UTD.187.2023.11.00_EN Operating instructions G series Attention! Verify that the machine shaft end has dimensions, tolerances and roughness as stated in fig. 5.10.1 ... 5.10.3 and tab. 5.10.1; following these instructions the correct running of shrink disc will be granted.\nPre-arrange a proper protection of the shrink disc against accidental contacts.\nInstalling Attention! Do not tighten the screws of shrink disc before mounting the gear reducer onto machine shaft in order not to deform the hollow shaft. When keying the shrink disc follow these instructions: \u2013 carefully degrease the surfaces of hollow shaft and shaft end of driven machine to be fitted; \u2013 \u0007 mount the shrink disc on the gear reducer hollow shaft taking care to lubricate the only external surface, first; position the shrink disc axially to \u00abQ\u00bb dimension (see tab. 5.10.1).\n\u2013 \u0007 slightly tighten a first group of three screws positioned at about 120\u00b0 as shown for example in the figure 5.10.4; \u2013 \u0007 tighten through dynamometric wrench \u2013 balanced to a value aproximately higher than 5% compared to the one foreseen in tab. 5.10.1 \u2013 the bolts of the shrink disc, by a continuous sequence (not crossing) see fig. 5.10.5 and during several phases (approx. 1/4 turn at a time) until no 1/4 turn is possible anymore; \u2013 \u0007 do again 1 or 2 passages with dynamometric wrench verifying that the tightening torque stated in tab. 5.10.1 has been realized; \u2013 \u0007 when having heavy duty cycles, with frequent reversals, verify again after some hours of running, the bolt tightening torque.\n\u2013 \u0007 verify the tightening torque of screws at every maintenance interval (oil exchange) or in case of anomalous vibrations.\nRemoving Before starting the disassembling operation, be sure that no torque nor load is applied to shrink disc, shaft or other connected elements.\nAttention! Do not completely remove fastening screws before locking rings are disengaged. Risk of serious injury!\nClean off any rusty areas. Loosen the fastening screws one after the other only by using approx. \u00bd turn at a time and by a continuous sequence (not crossing), until shrink disc can be moved on hollow shaft.\nRemove the gear reducer from machine shaft end.\nFig. 5.10.4 Fig. 5.10.5 20 Operating instructions G series UTD.187.2023.11.00_EN High speed shaft end Low speed shaft end Solid low speed shaft end Gear reducer shaft end Machine shaft 5.11 - Mounting of components on high and low speed shaft ends 1) Values valid for high speed shaft end.\n2) Values valid for standard low speed shaft end.\n3) Values valid for solid low speed shaft end.\n4) Maximum angular disalinement of keyways on double extension shafts.\n5) For low speed shaft ends: E = 97 (E = 101 if double extension); value not to standanrd.\n6) Value not to standard.\n7) For MR 3I with low speed shaft end, E dimension increases by 1.\nShaft end Parallel key Keyway D E d S L a/24) b \ue033 h \ue033 l b t t1 \u00d8 \u00d8 arc min h9 h11 H9 hub 1) 2) 3) 1) 2) 3) 1) 2) 3) 1) 2) 3) N9 shaft shaft hub 11 j 6 \u2013 \u2013 23 \u2013 M5 3,6 9,4 \u2013 \u2013 4 \ue033 4 \ue03318 \u2013 4 2,5 12,7 14 j 6 \u2013 \u2013 30 \u2013 M6 4,6 11,4 \u2013 \u2013 5 \ue033 5 \ue03325 \u2013 5 3 16,2 16 j 6 \u2013 \u2013 30 \u2013 M6 4,6 11,4 \u2013 \u2013 5 \ue033 5 \ue03325 \u2013 5 3 18,2 19 j 6 h7 \u2013 40 30 M6 4,6 11,4 13,4 5,43 6 \ue033 6 \ue03336 25 6 3,5 21,7 24 j 6 h7 \u2013 50 367) M8 5,9 15,1 17,1 5,16 8 \ue033 7 \ue03345 25 8 4 27,2 28 j 6 \u2013 \u2013 60 \u2013 M8 5,9 15,1 \u2013 \u2013 8 \ue033 7 \ue03345 \u2013 8 4 31,2 30 \u2013 h7 \u2013 58 587) M 0 7,6 \u2013 20,4 4,13 8 \ue033 7 \ue03345 45 8 4 33,2 32 k 6 h7 \u2013 80 587) M10 7,6 18,4 20,4 3,87 10 \ue033 8 \ue03370 50 10 5 35,3 38 k 6 h7 \u2013 80 58 M10 7,6 18,4 20,4 3,27 10 \ue033 8 \ue03370 50 10 5 41,3 40 \u2013 h7 \u2013 \u2013 58 M10 7,6 \u2013 20,4 3,7 12 \ue033 8 \ue03350 50 12 5 43,3 42 k 6 \u2013 \u2013 110 \u2013 M12 9,5 22,5 \u2013 \u2013 12 \ue033 8 \ue03390 \u2013 12 5 45,3 45 k 6 \u2013 \u2013 110 \u2013 M12 9,5 22,5 \u2013 \u2013 14 \ue033 9 \ue03390 \u2013 14 5,5 48,8 48 k 6 h7 k6 110 82 M12 9,5 22,5 26,5 3,08 14 \ue033 9 \ue03390 70 14 5,5 51,8 55 m 6 \u2013 110 \u2013 M12 9,5 22,5 \u2013 \u2013 16 \ue03310 \ue03390 \u2013 16 6 59,3 60 m 6 h7 k6 140 1055) M16 12,7 27,3 35,3 2,46 18 \ue03311 \ue033110 90 18 7 64,4 65 m6 \u2013 \u2013 140 \u2013 M16 12,7 27,3 \u2013 2,33 18 \ue03311 \ue033110 \u2013 18 7 69,4 70 m 6 h7 k6 140 105 M16 12,7 27,3 35,3 2,55 20 \ue03312 \ue033125 90 20 7,5 74,9 75 m 6 \u2013 \u2013 140 \u2013 M16 12,7 27,3 \u2013 \u2013 20 \ue03312 \ue033125 \u2013 20 7,5 79,9 80 m 6 h7 k6 170 130 M20 16 34 44 2,23 22 \ue03314 \ue033140 110 22 9 85,4 90 m 6 h7 k6 170 130 M20 16 34 44 1,99 25 \ue03314 \ue033140 110 25 9 95,4 95 m 6 \u2013 \u2013 170 \u2013 M20 16 34 \u2013 \u2013 25 \ue03314 \ue033140 \u2013 25 9 100,4 100 \u2013 j6 k6 \u2013 165 M24 19 \u2013 41 1,79 28 \ue03316 \ue033180 140 28 10 106,4 110 m 6 j6 k6 210 165 M24 19 41 41 1,63 28 \ue03316 \ue033180 140 28 10 116,4 125 \u2013 j6 k6 \u2013 2006) M30 22 \u2013 45 1,71 32 \ue03318 \ue033 \u2013 180 32 11 132,4 140 \u2013 j6 k6 \u2013 200 M30 22 \u2013 45 1,52 36 \ue03320 \ue033 \u2013 180 36 12 148,4 160 \u2013 j6 k6 \u2013 240 M36 27 \u2013 54 1,33 40 \ue03322 \ue033 \u2013 220 40 13 169,4 180 \u2013 j6 k6 \u2013 240 M36 27 \u2013 54 1,18 45 \ue03325 \ue033 \u2013 220 45 15 190,4 190 m 6 \u2013 \u2013 280 \u2013 M36 27 54 \u2013 1,12 45 \ue03325 \ue033250 \u2013 45 15 200,4 200 m 6 \u2013 \u2013 280 \u2013 M36 27 54 \u2013 1,07 45 \ue03325 \ue033250 \u2013 45 15 210,4 21 UTD.187.2023.11.00_EN Operating instructions G series In general, it is recommended to machine the hole of the parts keyed onto shaft end to H7 tolerance.\nFor high speed shaft end with D \ue03e 55 mm, provided that load is uniform and light, tolerance can be G7.\nFor low speed shaft ends, provided that load is not uniform and light, tolerance must be K7.\nBefore mounting, thoroughly clean mating surfaces and lubricate against seizure and fretting corrosion.\nAttention! Assemble and disassemble with the aid of jacking screws and pullers using tapped holes at shaft butt-end, taking care to avoid impacts and shocks which may irremediably damage the bearings, the circlips or other parts.\nFor couplings H7/m6 and K7/j6 it is advisable that the part to be keyed is preheated to a temperature of 80 \u00f7 100 \u00b0C.\nThe couplings having a tip speed on external diameter up to 20 m/s must be statically balanced; for higher tip speeds they must be dynamically balanced.\nWhere the transmission link between gear reducer and machine or motor generates shaft end loads, ensure that: \u2013 loads do not rise above catalog values; \u2013 transmission overhang is kept to a minimum; \u2013 drive-chains should not be tensioned (if necessary \u2013 alternating loads and/or motion \u2013 foresee suitable chain tighteners); \u2013 in the gear transmission systems there is a proper backlash (\u2248 0,03 \u00f7 0,04 mm) between pinion and rack; \u2013 drive-belts should not be over-tensioned.\nFor splined couplings apply adequate antirust-products.\n5.12 - Backstop device The presence on gear reducer of backstop device is stated by the arrow near the low speed shaft, indicating the free rotation.\nProvide a protection system where a backstop device breaking could cause personal injury or property damage. Make sure that the direction of rotation in machine, gear reducer and motor all correspond correctly.\nAttention! One or more startings in the false direction, even if short, could irremediably damage the backstop device, the coupling seats and/or the electric motor.\nIncorrect Correct 22 Operating instructions G series UTD.187.2023.11.00_EN 6 - Lubrication 6.1 - General Gear reducers and gearmotors must be lubricated with polyglycol or polyalphaolephines based synthetic oil depending on the series; they are supplied FILLED WITH OIL or WITHOUT OIL according to type and size (see ch. 6.2 and 6.3). When supplying WITHOUT OIL, the filling up to specified level is Buyer\u2019s responsibility and has to be carried out with gear reducer at rest; normally stated by means of transparent level plug (see ch. 6.4 or eventual SPT sketch attached to present instructions). Every gear reducer is equipped with lubrication name plate.\nConcerning lubricant type, how supplied status of gear reducers, plugs, filling instructions, oil-change interval, etc. see lubrication table at ch. 6.2 and 6.3.\nBe sure that, for gear reducers and gearmotors sizes \ue03e 100, the filler plug is equipped with filter and valve (symbol ; see fig. 6.1.1). When these gear reducers are required filled with oil (non-standard design) the filler plug is not mounted but sent separately; The installer will take care of the assembly in the right position (see ch. 6.4 or eventual SPT sketch attached) replacing the fitted plug.\nIf gear reducer or gearmotor is supplied with transparent oil level plug (size \ue03e 100), the necessary lubricant quantity is the one which reaches a.m. level at gear reducer at rest, in center line, and not the approximate quantity given on the catalog.\nWhen gear reducer or gearmotor is provided with a level plug with dipstick (see fig. 6.1.2), fill with oil up to specified level on rod.\nWhen gear reducer or gearmotor is provided with a plug for flowing over level (red colour, see fig. 6.1.3) fill after unscrewing a.m. plug in order to check the obtained level by oil outlet. Usually bearings are automatically and continuously lubricated (bathed, splashed, through pipes or by a pump) utilising the main gear reducer lubricant. The same applies for backstop devices, when fitted to gear reducers.\nIn certain gear reducers in vertical mounting positions V5 and V6, and bevel helical gear reducers in horizontal positions B3, B6 (though not gearmotors in this case, for which the above indications hold good) upper bearings are independently lubricated with a special grease \u00abfor life\u00bb, assuming pollution-free surroundings. The same applies for motor bearings (except some cases in which relubrication device is adopted) and backstop devices when fitted to motors.\nAlways be sure that the gear reducer is located as per the mounting position ordered - including the inclined mounting positions (e.g. B3 38\u00b0 V5) - which appears on the name plate (see ch. 3.2). In case of oscillating mounting positions the gear reducers are equipped with auxiliary name plate with statement of mounting position for the oil filling and the level check during maintenance.\nFor mounting positions, oil quantity and plug position see ch. 6.3 and 6.4.\nCombined gear reducers. Lubrication remains independent, thus data relative to each single gear reducer hold good.\nFig. 6.1.1 Filler plug with filter and valve Fig. 6.1.2 Level plug with dipstick Fig. 6.1.3 Spilway plug 2I, 3I, 4I (100, 125), m.p.

almost equal numerically to motor mass, stated in kg, multiplied by 10.\nX [mm] distance from motor center of gravity from flange surface.\nHF [mm] supplied in table according to gear reducer size and flange diameter P1.\nVery long and thin motors, though with bending moments lower than prescribed limits, may generate anomalous vibrations during the operation. In these cases it is necessary to foresee a proper additional motor support (see motor specific documentation).\nIn the dynamic applications where the gearmotor is subject to translations, rotations or oscillations, some stresses exceeding the usually admissible ones can be generated (e.g. shaft mounting): consult us for the verification of specific case.\n36 Operating instructions G series UTD.187.2023.11.00_EN 8 - Cooling system 8.1 - Fan cooling If there is fan on the gear reducer verify that there is sufficient space allowing for adequate circulation of cooling air also after fitting coupling protection. If a coupling protection is fitted (drilled case or wire netting), smooth, the coupling hub, if necessary.\n8.2 - Cooling by coil or by internal heat exchanger The presence of coil is given by water inlets (pipes DIN 2353) protruding from the housing or from the inspection cover as shown in the following figures.\nair Attention! Do not tamper with the eventual stop plate in order to keep the pipes locked; in particular keep the pipe locked while tightening the nut of connection pipe.\nUnless specific indications given on the documentation attached to present instructions, water fed into the system must: \u2013 be not too hard; \u2013 be at max temperature +20 \u00b0C; \u2013 capacity 10 \u00f7 20 dm3/min; \u2013 \u0007 pressure 0,2 \u00f7 0,4 MPa (2 \u00f7 4 bar); the load loss of the coil, according to capacity and water pressure, is of 0,6 \u00f7 0,8 bar for diameter d = 16 and 0,8 \u00f7 1 for diameter d = 12.\nWhere ambient temperature may be less than 0 \u00b0C, make provision for water drain and compressed air inlet, so as to be able to empty out the coil completely and avoid freezing up.\nThe direction of flow of the cooling water is discretionary.\nIn case of too high water input pressure, install a safety valve balanced at a proper operating threshold.\nThe ends of the cooling coil protruding from the gear reducer must not be damaged (bent, dented, obstructed) as this can prejudice the correct flow of water for cooling or result in leaks. Before connecting the coil to the pipe fittings used for feeding and draining of the cooling water, first rinse to clear out any possible obstructions.\nFor the connection it is sufficient to use a smooth metallic tube having a d external diameter as per table.\nThe thermostatic valve permits to have water circulation automatically and without auxiliary supply need, when gear reducer oil reaches the set temperature. The valve sensor is equipped with immerson bulb. Mounting and setting, adjustable within +50 \u00f7 +90 \u00b0C, must be mounted during the assembly. For the setting use the control knob on valve head.\nFor ambient temperature lower than 0 \u00b0C consult us.\nSetting values advised for operating temperature: +50 \u00f7 +65 \u00b0C.\nAttention! It is necessary to protect the thermostatic valve from any shock or stroke.\nA Tab. 8.2.1 - Coil Size gear reducer d A1) B1) spanner \u00d8 \u2248 \u2248 125 ... 180 10 40 40 22 200 ... 280 12 50 40 22 320 ... 360 16 60 45 30 400, 401 16 140 45 30 1) \u0007 Values valid for B3 mounting position;

After the running-in period it may be necessary to verify the gear reducer fixing bolt tightness.\nSize 63 64 80 81 100 125 140 160 smax 2 3 6 6 7 9 9 11 For sizes 63 ... 160, the hollow low speed shaft protection cap has to be keyed into seal ring seat that, for this reason, must be pushed towards gear reducer inside for the maximum depth stated in the table.\nFor this operation use the protection cap as a tool, hammering it carefully along the periphery (see fig. above). For ATEX design gear reducers, this accessory is not available.\n9.9 - Hollow low speed shaft protection cap 44 Operating instructions G series UTD.187.2023.11.00_EN 11 - Maintenance 11.1 - General At machine rest, verify at regular intervals (more or less frequently according to environment and use): a) all external surfaces are clean and air passages to the gear reducer or gearmotor are free, in order that cooling remains fully effective; b) oil level and deterioration degree (check with cold gear reducer at rest); c) correct fastening screws tightening.\nDuring the operation check: \u2013 \u0007 noise level; \u2013 \u0007 vibrations; \u2013 \u0007 sealings; \u2013 \u0007 etc.\nAttention! After a running period, gear reducer is subject to a light internal overpressure which may cause burning liquid discharge. Therefore, before loosening whichever plug (filler plug included) wait until gear reducer has become cold and open it carefully; if not possible, take the necessary protection measures against burning due to warm oil contact. In all cases, always proceed with great care.\nMaximum oil temperatures indicated on lubrication table do not represent a hindrance to the gear reducer regular running.\n11.2 - Oil change Execute the operation at machine rest and cold gear reducer.\nPre-arrange a proper waste oil collection system, unscrew the drain plug and the filler plug in order to facilitate the draining; dispose the waste lubricant according to the laws in force.\nWash internally the gear reducer's housing using the same oil type applied during the running; the oil used for this washing can be re-used for further washings after filtering with 25 \u03bcm of filtration standard.\nFill the gear reducer again up to level.\nDuring the oil change, it is necessary to replace the seal rings.\nWhen dismounting the cap (whenever gear reducers are provided with), reset the sealing with adhesive on cleaned and degreased mating surfaces.\nFor lubrication intervals see table 6.2.\nApart from running hours: \u2014 replace mineral oil at least each 3 years; \u2014 \u0007 replace or regenerate synthetic oil each 5 - 8 years according to gear reducer size, running and environmental conditions.\nNever mix different makes of synthetic oil; if oil-change involves switching to a type different from that used hitherto, then give the gear reducer a through clean-out.\n11.3 - Coil and internal heat exchanger In case of long non-running periods at ambient temperatures lower than 0 \u00b0C, the coil or the internal heat exchanger on the inspection cover should be emptied out using compressed air to blast out all the coolant, so as to avoid freezing-up which would cause the coil to break.\nVerify that there are no deposits inside the coil which may obstruct water circulation or affect cooling. If any, wash the coil with suitable chemical cleaning products or consult Rossi.\nCheck the internal heat exchanger periodically and, if necessary, clean the exchange surfaces taking care not to damage the finned surfaces.\n11.4 - Seal rings It is always recommended that the seal rings are replaced with new ones when they are removed or during periodic checks of gear reducer; in this case, the new ring should be generously greased and positioned so that the seal line does not work on the same point of sliding contact as the previous ring.\nOil seals must be protected against heat radiation, also during the shrink fitting of parts, if applicable.\nDuration depends on several factors such as dragging speed, temperature, ambient conditions, etc.; as a rough guide it can vary from 3150 to 25000 h.\nIn case of designs with labyrinth seal and greaser (\u00abTaconite\u00bb), re-grease every 3 000 h of running or every 6 months with grease KL\u00dcBER STABURAGS NBU 8 EP (unless otherwise stated).\n45 UTD.187.2023.11.00_EN Operating instructions G series \u2013\u0007 1) To ISO 8579-1.\n2) Mean value of measurement at 1 m from external profile of gear reducer standing in free field on a reflecting surface.\n3) For n1 710 \u00f7 1 800 min-1, modify tabulated values thus: n1 = 710 min-1, -3 dB(A); n1 = 900 min-1, -2 dB(A); n1 = 1 120 min-1, -1 dB(A); n1 = 1 800 min-1, +2 dB(A).\n4) For sizes R I 225, 280 and 360, increase values of 1 dB(A).\n5) For R C2I 400 and 401 iN \u2264 63 and iN \u2265 71, respectively.\n6) For R C3I 400 and 401: LWA = 92 and LpA = 80.\n11.5 - Bearings Since there are many different types of bearings in a gear reducer (roller, tapered roller, straight roller, etc.) and each bearing works with different loads and speeds depending on the input speed, the nature of the load of the driven machine, the transmission ratio, etc., and with different lubricants (oil bath, oil splash, grease, oil circulation, etc.), it is not possible to define any periodical maintenance and replacement of bearings in advance.\nIf a precautionally maintenance is required, undertake periodical checks to verify noise level and vibration with the help of appropiate diagnostic equipment and instruments. If the measured values worsen even slightly it is necessary to stop gear reducer or gear motor and after having inspected inside the unit replace the bearings which are subject to breakdown.\n11.6 - Metal filler plug with filter and valve When the gear reducer or gearmotor (size \ue03e 100) is equipped with metal filler plug and valve (see fig. in order to clean it, it is necessary to unscrew it from the gear reducer (preventing any debris or other foreign items from entering the reducer, disassemble the cover, wash it with solvent, dry with compressed air and reassemble it). This operation is to be made according to environment conditions.\n11.7 - Hollow low speed shaft In order to remove the hollow low speed shaft of the helical and bevel helical gear reducers (this is the first operation to perform when disassembling the gear reducer) turn the shaft until the keyway is facing the intermediate shaft as indicated in fig. 5 and push the shaft from the reference groove side (circumferencial keyway on shaft shoulder).\n11.8 - Sound levels LWA and LpA Standard production sound power level LWA [dB(A)]1) and mean sound pressure level LpA [dB(A)]2) assuming nominal load, and input speed n1 = 1 400 3) min-1.

This Code is the first formal step towards Rossi\u2019s adop tion of a new Organization, Management and Control Model (hereinafter the \u201cModel 231\u201d) defined to prevent the crimes listed in Legislative Decree 231/2001 (hereinafter the \u201cDecree\u201d). The Code is one of the essential protocols for the establishment of Model 231 and is an integral part of it, together with the system of sanctions (hereinafter \u201cDisciplinary Code\u201d) which the Company has decided to adopt in order to reinforce the rules of the Code and the provisions of the Decree, and thus of Model 231.\nThe Code complies with the principles set forth in the latest Confindustria Guidelines issued in June 2020.\nThe Code also provides mandatory guidelines of conduct for all the foreign companies controlled by Rossi, in compliance with local laws. Any reference to the regulations and legislation of Italian law in the text of the Code should be considered valid and binding only in Italy.\n1. INTRODUCTION 8 Code of Ethics The Company pursues the achievement of economic sustainability through continuous improvement of its processes, aimed at balanced and sustainable growth of the company and its supply chains. In particular, Rossi adopts ethically responsible production models that respect and safeguard human rights, environmental well-being and the welfare of the community.\nTo this effect, Rossi promotes and implements a business model that combines its corporate objectives with the social and environmental objectives of the local area, from a perspective of total quality.\nRossi is aware that its business acquires value when based on credibility and reputation, intangible factors that are capable - in themselves - of creating tangible values. Accordingly, the Company promotes its products and services in compliance with all legal regulations and rules established to protect the interests of customers and fair competition.\nThe Company is conscious of the major role it plays in relation to the market, economic development and the well-being of the people who work and cooperate with them, as well as of the community where it is based.\nTherefore, the Company deems it essential to clearly and firmly express its ideals, culture and values which underlie the behavior of its corporate boards, management and the people who work with, and for the Company towards public administration, customers, suppliers, credit institutes and the entire community, for the trust they place in the Company\u2019s operations.\nThis document was prepared by Rossi for the purpose of establishing a code of conduct, based on the core values of the Company and the Rossi Group, to serve as a clear reference for all activities in which it is involved in its internal and external relations.\nThis Code of Ethics (hereinafter also the \u201cCode\u201d) thus defines the general principles of behavior that apply, without exception, to all those working to achieve the objectives of Rossi S.p.A. and all Rossi Group companies (also referred to as Rossi).\nThis Code of Ethics is an integral part and fundamental element of the Organization, Management and Control Model 1.1 FOREWORD 1.2 PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF APPLICATION 9 Code of Ethics governed by Legislative Decree no. 231/2001 and adopted by Rossi; therefore, the implementation of the Code is subject to the control of the Supervisory Board appointed in accordance with the aforementioned Legislative Decree no. 231/2001 and violation of its provisions is punishable in accordance with the aforementioned Model.\nThe recipients of the Code of Ethics are people assigned to the governance of the Company, employees, collaborators, consultants, third parties and all those who; directly or indirectly, establish permanent or temporary relations or relationships with the Company. The Recipients must never fail to observe the fundamental principles that inspire the Code of Ethics, such as honesty, moral integrity, fairness, transparency and objectivity in their pursuit of the corporate objectives.\nEach one, within the area of responsibility of their specific role, must provide the highest possible level of professionalism and perform their assigned activities with commitment, making a concrete contribution to the achievement of the corporate objectives.\nRossi has no wish to enter into, or continue relationships with anyone who proves unwilling to share the content or spirit of this Code, or who violates its principles or rules of conduct. In particular, since the actions taken by the Company\u2019s suppliers are sometimes attributed to the Company itself, and can affect its reputation, Rossi requires those bound by supply contracts with the Company to comply with the standards of the Code of Ethics.\n1.3 RECIPIENTS AND GENERAL PRINCIPLES 11 Code of Ethics 2. CORPORATE VALUES AND RULES OF CONDUCT R ossi is aware of the essential social and environment role of its activities. Rossi promotes and demands models of ethical behavior in the performance of work activities based on the principles of legality, good contractual faith, loyalty, fairness and transparency. All adopted behavior must be formally and substantially legitimate in order to protect and enhance Rossi\u2019s credibility, reputation, reliability and image. Corruption, illicit gain and collusion are strictly prohibited without exception. Acceptance of money or gifts of any nature or amount is prohibited unless clearly shown to be mere acts of business courtesy, such as not to influence the behavior of the recipient; any fact to the contrary must be reported to one\u2019s immediate superior and/or the Supervisory Board.\nRossi promotes and develops behaviors among its staff that foster a sense of identification with the company, and an awareness that the professionalism of its activities can only be considered adequate if this commitment is shared and applied in practice by all its staff.\nAll Recipients, moreover, must take every possible precaution to avoid any form of discrimination or physical and psychological harassment, and, in particular, any discrimination based on race, nationality, sex, age, physical disability, sexual orientation, political opinion, trade union membership or religious belief.\nRossi promotes the sharing of information, dialogue and collaboration with the maximum transparency towards institutions, associations and the social context in which it operates. It is prohibited to make false statements to any institution, association or community.\n2.1 ETHICAL PRINCIPLES 12 Code of Ethics Acting in accordance with the law is a priority requirement for Rossi. Compliance with the law is an essential principle at Rossi.

Furthermore, such practices must reflect Rossi principles and procedures with ethically correct conduct, while putting into effect the Code of Ethics standards to preserve and enhance our reputation as a responsible employer.\nUnder no circumstances may conduct in violation of current laws and regulations, or this Code, be considered beneficial to Rossi and, therefore, no one may consider themselves authorized to engage in such conduct under the pretext of benefit to the Company.\nRossi pursues the goal of maximum integrity and fairness in its relations and contractual dealings with public institutions and local authorities, and with Public Administration in general1. The Company also believes that the active involvement of va-rious stakeholders, from local communities to public institu-tions, and from associations to university and research bodies, can be a key element for its own development.
