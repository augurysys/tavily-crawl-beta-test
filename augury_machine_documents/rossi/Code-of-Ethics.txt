7 Code of Ethics R ossi S.p.A - part of Rossi International AG, part of Moovimenta AG - and all Rossi Group companies have adopted this Code of Ethics, in line with the Group’s values, in order to mitigate the risks of irregularities and limit the danger of committing the offenses listed in Legislative Decree 231/2001.
The Code of Ethics (hereinafter the “Code”) is an official document adopted autonomously by Rossi Group (hereinafter referred to as “Rossi” or the “Company”) that formally defines the key principles and core values that Rossi is committed to upholding and enforcing in its business activities, and the standards of conduct to be observed by the corporate bodies and all Rossi employees and collaborators.
The Code, which is aimed at ensuring a high standard of ethics in the conduct of the Company’s business, is also one of the tools prepared by the Company to ensure adequate prevention, detection and countering of violations of current laws applicable to the Company.
Rossi believes that ethical conduct in business is a necessary condition for its success as well as a tool for promoting its image.
The Code is also the point of reference for all those who conduct business on behalf of; and in the interest of Rossi. This Code is the first formal step towards Rossi’s adop tion of a new Organization, Management and Control Model (hereinafter the “Model 231”) defined to prevent the crimes listed in Legislative Decree 231/2001 (hereinafter the “Decree”). The Code is one of the essential protocols for the establishment of Model 231 and is an integral part of it, together with the system of sanctions (hereinafter “Disciplinary Code”) which the Company has decided to adopt in order to reinforce the rules of the Code and the provisions of the Decree, and thus of Model 231.
The Code complies with the principles set forth in the latest Confindustria Guidelines issued in June 2020.
The Code also provides mandatory guidelines of conduct for all the foreign companies controlled by Rossi, in compliance with local laws. Any reference to the regulations and legislation of Italian law in the text of the Code should be considered valid and binding only in Italy.
1. INTRODUCTION 8 Code of Ethics The Company pursues the achievement of economic sustainability through continuous improvement of its processes, aimed at balanced and sustainable growth of the company and its supply chains. In particular, Rossi adopts ethically responsible production models that respect and safeguard human rights, environmental well-being and the welfare of the community.
To this effect, Rossi promotes and implements a business model that combines its corporate objectives with the social and environmental objectives of the local area, from a perspective of total quality.
Rossi is aware that its business acquires value when based on credibility and reputation, intangible factors that are capable - in themselves - of creating tangible values. Accordingly, the Company promotes its products and services in compliance with all legal regulations and rules established to protect the interests of customers and fair competition.
The Company is conscious of the major role it plays in relation to the market, economic development and the well-being of the people who work and cooperate with them, as well as of the community where it is based.
Therefore, the Company deems it essential to clearly and firmly express its ideals, culture and values which underlie the behavior of its corporate boards, management and the people who work with, and for the Company towards public administration, customers, suppliers, credit institutes and the entire community, for the trust they place in the Company’s operations.
This document was prepared by Rossi for the purpose of establishing a code of conduct, based on the core values of the Company and the Rossi Group, to serve as a clear reference for all activities in which it is involved in its internal and external relations.
This Code of Ethics (hereinafter also the “Code”) thus defines the general principles of behavior that apply, without exception, to all those working to achieve the objectives of Rossi S.p.A. and all Rossi Group companies (also referred to as Rossi).
This Code of Ethics is an integral part and fundamental element of the Organization, Management and Control Model 1.1 FOREWORD 1.2 PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF APPLICATION 9 Code of Ethics governed by Legislative Decree no. 231/2001 and adopted by Rossi; therefore, the implementation of the Code is subject to the control of the Supervisory Board appointed in accordance with the aforementioned Legislative Decree no. 231/2001 and violation of its provisions is punishable in accordance with the aforementioned Model.
The recipients of the Code of Ethics are people assigned to the governance of the Company, employees, collaborators, consultants, third parties and all those who; directly or indirectly, establish permanent or temporary relations or relationships with the Company. The Recipients must never fail to observe the fundamental principles that inspire the Code of Ethics, such as honesty, moral integrity, fairness, transparency and objectivity in their pursuit of the corporate objectives.
Each one, within the area of responsibility of their specific role, must provide the highest possible level of professionalism and perform their assigned activities with commitment, making a concrete contribution to the achievement of the corporate objectives.
Rossi has no wish to enter into, or continue relationships with anyone who proves unwilling to share the content or spirit of this Code, or who violates its principles or rules of conduct. In particular, since the actions taken by the Company’s suppliers are sometimes attributed to the Company itself, and can affect its reputation, Rossi requires those bound by supply contracts with the Company to comply with the standards of the Code of Ethics.
1.3 RECIPIENTS AND GENERAL PRINCIPLES 11 Code of Ethics 2. CORPORATE VALUES AND RULES OF CONDUCT R ossi is aware of the essential social and environment role of its activities.
