The following table lists the residual risks that the user must deal with in compliance with the instructions contained in this document and in those eventually attached to the shipment.
Nature/Cause of Risk Countermeasures Installation and maintenance operations The component must be handled, installed, commissioned, operated, inspected, maintained, and repaired only by qualified, responsible personnel who must carefully read and strictly follow all instructions in this document, including any instructions enclosed with the shipment. They shall also be specifically instructed and have the necessary experience to recognize the hazards and potential hazards (electrical or mechanical) associated with these products, such as, but not limited to: - presence of electrical voltage; - presence of temperature higher than 50 °C; - presence of moving parts during operation; - presence of suspended loads; - presence of possible high sound level (> 85 dB (A).
It must be equipped with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and be familiar with and comply with all applicable regulations regarding proper installation and current safety laws in order to ensure the safety of persons and avoid significant damage to the machine or system.
Falling or projecting objects For gearboxes equipped with a backstop, provide a protection system against the projection of objects resulting from the breaking of the backstop.
For gearboxes fitted with a coupling (fast and/or slow shaft), provide protection against the projection of objects resulting from breakage of the coupling itself.
For shaft-mounted gear units, provide appropriate safety devices against - Loosening or breaking of the mounting screws; - Rotation or loosening of the gear unit from the machine pin due to accidental breakage of the reaction constraint; - accidental breakage of the machine pin.
Movable elements Provide safety guards for unused shaft ends and accessible fan cover passages (or other).
Any work on the gearbox or gearmotor must be carried out with the machine stopped and disconnected from the power supply and the gearbox or gearmotor cold.
Extreme Temperatures During operation, the gearboxes may have hot surfaces (> 50 °C); before starting any operation, always wait for the gearbox or gearmotor to cool down (wait about 1 to 3 hours depending on the size); if necessary, carry out a temperature measurement on the surface of the gearbox or gearmotor near the fast shaft. The same applies to the hydraulic coupling, if present.
After a period of operation, the gearbox is subjected to a slight internal overpressure that can result in the leakage of burning fluid. Therefore, before loosening the caps (of any kind) wait for the gearbox to cool down; otherwise, use appropriate protection (PPE) against burns resulting from accidental contact with hot oil.
In any case, always proceed with the utmost caution.
Noise Depending on the size, gear ratio, gearbox, type of service, and mounting system of the gearbox or gearmotor, the noise emission level may exceed 85 dB(A). Perform field measurements and, if necessary, equip the personnel concerned with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).

For the lifting and transport of gear reducer (or gearmotor) use through holes or threads on the gear reducer housing feet as stated in the fi gures below.
Avoid unbalanced lifting (during the movement, inclination must not exceed max ±15° as to mounting position) and, if necessary, use additional belts to balance the weight.
Do not use any shaft ends.
Do not use motor eyebolts.
Do not use front threads of shaft ends or eventual external pipes.
Do not add supplementary loads to the gear reducer or gearmotor mass.
Attention! During the lifting and handling: − do not stand under the suspended loads; − do not damage the gear reducer with an inadequate transport; − keep the gear reducers fi lled with oil in the mounting position foreseen in the order.
Belt to be used exclusively to ensure the motor, when directly mounted, against oscillations due to transport; not to be used for the lifting of entire gearmotor group.

The gear reducers filled with oil must be positioned according to the mounting position stated on name plate during transport and storage.
Every six months rotate the shafts (some revolutions are sufficient) to prevent damage to bearings and seal rings.
Assuming normal surroundings and the provision of adequate protection during transit, the unit is protected for storage up to 1 year.
For a 2 year storing period in normal surroundings it is necessary to pay attention also to following instructions: – generously grease the seal rings, the shafts and the unpainted machined surfaces, if any, and periodically check the conservation state of the protective anti-rust oil; – completely fill the gear reducers with lubrication oil and the specified level before commissioning.
For storages longer than 2 years or in aggressive surroundings or outdoors, consult Rossi.
MR CI, MR C2I MR ICI 12 Operating instructions G series UTD.187.2023.11.00_EN 5 Installation of gear reducer 5.1 - General Before the installation, verify that: – There are no damages on shafts and on mating surfaces; – gear reducer specifi cations are adequate to ambient conditions (temperature, atmosphere, etc.); – the structure on which gear reducer is fi tted is plane, levelled and suffi ciently dimensioned in order to assure fi tting stability and vibration absence (vibration speed veff < 3,5 mm/s for PN < 15 kW and veff < 4,5 mm/s for PN > 15 kW are acceptable), keeping in mind all transmitted forces due to the masses, to the torque, to the radial and axial loads; – Used mounting position corresponds to the one stated on name plate; Attention! Bearing life, good shaft and coupling running depend on alignment precision between the shafts. Carefully align the gear reducer with the motor and the driven machine (with the aid of shims if need be).
Incorrect alignment may cause breakdown of shafts and/or bearings (which may cause overheatings) which may represent heavy danger for people.
Position the gear reducer or gearmotor so as to allow a free passage of air for cooling both gear reducer and motor (especially at motor fan sides).
– Avoid any obstruction to the air fl ow; heat sources near the gear reducer that might aff ect the temperature of cooling air and of gear reducer (for radiation); insuffi cient air recycle and applications hindering the steady dissipation of heat; Verify that the gear reducer housing is dust-free in order to achieve an effi cient heat dispersal.
Place the supplied adhesive pictogram identifying the risk associated with hot surfaces on the surface of the gear unit in a position visible to personnel involved in machine operation and maintenance.
Mating surfaces (of gear reducer and machine) must be clean and suffi ciently rough to provide a good friction coeffi cient (indicatively Ra 3,2 ÷ 6,3 µm). Remove by a scraper or solvent the eventual paint of gear reducer coupling surfaces When external loads are present use pins or locking blocks, if necessary.
When fi tting gear reducer and machine and/or gear reducer and eventual fl ange B5 it is recommended to use locking adhesives such on the fastening screws (also on fl ange mating surfaces).
For accessories not suplied by Rossi, pay attention to their dimensioning; consult us, if need be.
Before wiring-up the gearmotor make sure that motor voltage corresponds to input voltage. If direction of rotation is not as desired, invert two phases at the terminals.
Y-∆ starting should be adopted for no-load starting (or with a very small load) and for smooth starts, low starting current or other similar devices should be fi tted.
If overloads are imposed for long periods or if shocks or danger of jamming are envisaged, then motor-protection, electronic torque limiters, fl uid couplings, safety couplings, control units or other similar devices should be fi tted.
Usually protect the motor with a thermal cut-out however, where duty cycles involve a high number of on-load starts, it is necessari to utilise thermal probes for motor protection (fi tted on the wiring); magnetothermic breaker is unsuitable since its threshold must be set higher than the motor nominal current of rating.
Connect thermal probes, if any, to auxiliary safety circuits.
Use varistors and/or RC fi lters to limit voltage peaks due to contactors.
For gear reducers equipped with backstop device (see ch. 5.12), foresee a protection system where a backstop device breaking could cause personal injury or property damage.
Whenever a leakage of lubricant could cause heavy damages, increase the frequency of inspections and/or envisage appropriate control devices (e.g.: remote level gauge, etc.).
In polluting surroundings, take suitable precautions against lubricant contamination through seal rings or other.
For outdoor installation or in a hostile environment (corrosivity class C3 according to ISO 12944-2) protect the gear reducer or gearmotor with a proper anti-corrosion paint (see ch. 3.4), using water-repellent grease (especially around the rotary seating of seal rings and the accessible zones of shaft end). Gear reducers and gearmotors should be protected whenever possibile and by appropriate means from solar radiation and extremis of weather; weather protection becomes essential when high or low speed shafts are vertically disposed or when the motor is installed vertical with fan uppermost.
For ambient temperature greater than +40 °C or less than 0 °C, consult Rossi.
When gear reducer or gearmotor is supplied with water cooling by coil or independent cooling unit, see ch. 8.

5.6 - Mounting of hollow low speed shaft For machine shaft ends onto which the hollow shafts of gear reducers are to be keyed, h6, j6, and k6 tolerances are recommended, according to requirements.
Important! the shoulder diameter of the driven machine shaft end abutting with the gear reducer must be at least 1,18 ÷ 1,25 time the hollow shaft internal diameter. For other data on machine shaft end (in case of standard hollow low speed shaft, stepped shaft, with locking rings or bushings) see Rossi technical catalogs.
Attention! For vertical ceiling-type mounting and only for gear reducers equipped with locking rings or bushing, gear reducer support is due only to friction, for this reason it is advisable to provide it with a fastening system.
Attention! Even if the hollow low speed shafts machined in tollerance H7, a check through bott could reveal two areras with a slightly underdimensioned diameter (see Fig. 1): this und underdimensioning is intentional and not aff ecting the keying quality – which is improved in terms of duration and precision – and is not hindering the assembly of machine shaft end according to usual methodes, such as the one shown at fi g. a).
Attention! In order to facilitate the mounting of gear reducer onto machine shaft end, diameter D (**, see Fig. 2) is slightly overdimensioned as to nominal dimension, at hollow shaft input (standard, stepped, with shrink disc): this will not aff ect realiability.
5.7 - Gear reducer installing and removing In order to have an easier installing and removing of gear reducers and gearmotors with retaining ring groove (sizes 64 ... 401) – both with keyway and shrink disc – proceed as shown at fi g. 5.7.1 and 5.7.2 (excluding MR 3I 100 with motor sizes 112 and 3I 125 with motor size 132; consult us).
For MR 3I 64 ... 81, fi rst insert the washer with screw and the retaining ring into the gear reducer hollow shaft (on motor opposite side); then mount on machine shaft end.

For sizes 64 ... 360, when shaft end of driven machine has no shoulder, a spacer may be located between the retaining ring and the shaft end (as in the lower half on fig. 5.8.2). Parts in contact with the retaining ring must have sharp edges.

Tab. 5.9.1 Tightening torques for axial fastening bolts with locking rings or bushing Using locking rings (sizes 40 ... 63, fig. 5.9.1) or locking bushing (sizes 64 ... 360, fig. 5.9.2) will allow to have easier and more accurate installing and removing and to eliminate backlash between key and keyway, friction system complying with ATEX.
The locking rings or the locking bushing are fitted after mounting (for MR 3I 64 ... 81 insert the bushing onto machine shaft end or into hollow shaft before mounting; pay attention when positioning the keyway). Do not use molybdenum bisulphide or equivalent lubricant for the lubrication of the parts in contact. When tightening the bolt, we recommend the use of locking adhesives type Loctite or equivalent. For vertical ceiling-type mounting, contact us.
In case of axial fastening with locking rings or bushing – especially when having heavy duty cycles, with frequent reversals – verify, after some hours of running, the bolt tightening torque and eventually apply the locking adhesive again.
Respect the tightening torques stated in table 5.9.1.
Attention! In applications with travelling lifts, the locking bushing is not sufficient to guarantee a stable fitting of hollow low speed shaft with the machine shaft end, also when the axial fastening bolt is fastened with locking adhesive. In these cases, it is necessary to fit with hollow shaft and shrink disc. This is valid, in general, also when there is a high frequency of starting and brakings with motion reversal and when the ratio of inertia J/J0 is very high (  5).

Pre-arrange a proper protection of the shrink disc against accidental contacts.
Installing Attention! Do not tighten the screws of shrink disc before mounting the gear reducer onto machine shaft in order not to deform the hollow shaft. When keying the shrink disc follow these instructions: – carefully degrease the surfaces of hollow shaft and shaft end of driven machine to be fitted; –  mount the shrink disc on the gear reducer hollow shaft taking care to lubricate the only external surface, first; position the shrink disc axially to «Q» dimension (see tab. 5.10.1).
–  slightly tighten a first group of three screws positioned at about 120° as shown for example in the figure 5.10.4; –  tighten through dynamometric wrench – balanced to a value aproximately higher than 5% compared to the one foreseen in tab. 5.10.1 – the bolts of the shrink disc, by a continuous sequence (not crossing) see fig. 5.10.5 and during several phases (approx. 1/4 turn at a time) until no 1/4 turn is possible anymore; –  do again 1 or 2 passages with dynamometric wrench verifying that the tightening torque stated in tab. 5.10.1 has been realized; –  when having heavy duty cycles, with frequent reversals, verify again after some hours of running, the bolt tightening torque.
–  verify the tightening torque of screws at every maintenance interval (oil exchange) or in case of anomalous vibrations.
Removing Before starting the disassembling operation, be sure that no torque nor load is applied to shrink disc, shaft or other connected elements.
Attention! Do not completely remove fastening screws before locking rings are disengaged. Risk of serious injury!
Clean off any rusty areas. Loosen the fastening screws one after the other only by using approx. ½ turn at a time and by a continuous sequence (not crossing), until shrink disc can be moved on hollow shaft.
Remove the gear reducer from machine shaft end.

For high speed shaft end with D  55 mm, provided that load is uniform and light, tolerance can be G7.
For low speed shaft ends, provided that load is not uniform and light, tolerance must be K7.
Before mounting, thoroughly clean mating surfaces and lubricate against seizure and fretting corrosion.
Attention! Assemble and disassemble with the aid of jacking screws and pullers using tapped holes at shaft butt-end, taking care to avoid impacts and shocks which may irremediably damage the bearings, the circlips or other parts.
For couplings H7/m6 and K7/j6 it is advisable that the part to be keyed is preheated to a temperature of 80 ÷ 100 °C.
The couplings having a tip speed on external diameter up to 20 m/s must be statically balanced; for higher tip speeds they must be dynamically balanced.
Where the transmission link between gear reducer and machine or motor generates shaft end loads, ensure that: – loads do not rise above catalog values; – transmission overhang is kept to a minimum; – drive-chains should not be tensioned (if necessary – alternating loads and/or motion – foresee suitable chain tighteners); – in the gear transmission systems there is a proper backlash (≈ 0,03 ÷ 0,04 mm) between pinion and rack; – drive-belts should not be over-tensioned.
For splined couplings apply adequate antirust-products.
5.12 - Backstop device The presence on gear reducer of backstop device is stated by the arrow near the low speed shaft, indicating the free rotation.
Provide a protection system where a backstop device breaking could cause personal injury or property damage. Make sure that the direction of rotation in machine, gear reducer and motor all correspond correctly.
Attention! One or more startings in the false direction, even if short, could irremediably damage the backstop device, the coupling seats and/or the electric motor.
Incorrect Correct 22 Operating instructions G series UTD.187.2023.11.00_EN 6 - Lubrication 6.1 - General Gear reducers and gearmotors must be lubricated with polyglycol or polyalphaolephines based synthetic oil depending on the series; they are supplied FILLED WITH OIL or WITHOUT OIL according to type and size (see ch. 6.2 and 6.3). When supplying WITHOUT OIL, the filling up to specified level is Buyer’s responsibility and has to be carried out with gear reducer at rest; normally stated by means of transparent level plug (see ch. 6.4 or eventual SPT sketch attached to present instructions). Every gear reducer is equipped with lubrication name plate.
Concerning lubricant type, how supplied status of gear reducers, plugs, filling instructions, oil-change interval, etc. see lubrication table at ch. 6.2 and 6.3.
Be sure that, for gear reducers and gearmotors sizes  100, the filler plug is equipped with filter and valve (symbol ; see fig. 6.1.1). When these gear reducers are required filled with oil (non-standard design) the filler plug is not mounted but sent separately; The installer will take care of the assembly in the right position (see ch. 6.4 or eventual SPT sketch attached) replacing the fitted plug.
If gear reducer or gearmotor is supplied with transparent oil level plug (size  100), the necessary lubricant quantity is the one which reaches a.m. level at gear reducer at rest, in center line, and not the approximate quantity given on the catalog.
When gear reducer or gearmotor is provided with a level plug with dipstick (see fig. 6.1.2), fill with oil up to specified level on rod.
When gear reducer or gearmotor is provided with a plug for flowing over level (red colour, see fig. 6.1.3) fill after unscrewing a.m. plug in order to check the obtained level by oil outlet. Usually bearings are automatically and continuously lubricated (bathed, splashed, through pipes or by a pump) utilising the main gear reducer lubricant. The same applies for backstop devices, when fitted to gear reducers.
In certain gear reducers in vertical mounting positions V5 and V6, and bevel helical gear reducers in horizontal positions B3, B6 (though not gearmotors in this case, for which the above indications hold good) upper bearings are independently lubricated with a special grease «for life», assuming pollution-free surroundings. The same applies for motor bearings (except some cases in which relubrication device is adopted) and backstop devices when fitted to motors.
Always be sure that the gear reducer is located as per the mounting position ordered - including the inclined mounting positions (e.g. B3 38° V5) - which appears on the name plate (see ch. 3.2). In case of oscillating mounting positions the gear reducers are equipped with auxiliary name plate with statement of mounting position for the oil filling and the level check during maintenance.
For mounting positions, oil quantity and plug position see ch. 6.3 and 6.4.
Combined gear reducers. Lubrication remains independent, thus data relative to each single gear reducer hold good.

Unless specific indications given on the documentation attached to present instructions, water fed into the system must: – be not too hard; – be at max temperature +20 °C; – capacity 10 ÷ 20 dm3/min; –  pressure 0,2 ÷ 0,4 MPa (2 ÷ 4 bar); the load loss of the coil, according to capacity and water pressure, is of 0,6 ÷ 0,8 bar for diameter d = 16 and 0,8 ÷ 1 for diameter d = 12.
Where ambient temperature may be less than 0 °C, make provision for water drain and compressed air inlet, so as to be able to empty out the coil completely and avoid freezing up.
The direction of flow of the cooling water is discretionary.
In case of too high water input pressure, install a safety valve balanced at a proper operating threshold.
The ends of the cooling coil protruding from the gear reducer must not be damaged (bent, dented, obstructed) as this can prejudice the correct flow of water for cooling or result in leaks. Before connecting the coil to the pipe fittings used for feeding and draining of the cooling water, first rinse to clear out any possible obstructions.
For the connection it is sufficient to use a smooth metallic tube having a d external diameter as per table.
The thermostatic valve permits to have water circulation automatically and without auxiliary supply need, when gear reducer oil reaches the set temperature. The valve sensor is equipped with immerson bulb. Mounting and setting, adjustable within +50 ÷ +90 °C, must be mounted during the assembly. For the setting use the control knob on valve head.
For ambient temperature lower than 0 °C consult us.
Setting values advised for operating temperature: +50 ÷ +65 °C.
Attention! It is necessary to protect the thermostatic valve from any shock or stroke.

10 - Commissionning 10.1 - General Carry out an overall check, making particularly sure that the gear reducer is filled with lubricant.
If an external lubricating system is present (forced lubrication, cooling unit) oil is to be filled to the correct level with the external system full of oil.
Be sure that the cooling unit with coil, if present, is working during the gear reducer running (see ch. 5.5).
Where Y-∆ starting is being used, input voltage must match the motor lower voltage (∆ connection).
For asynchronous three-phase motor, if the direction of rotation is not as desired, invert two phases at the terminals.
For gear reducers equipped with backstop device, see ch. 5:12.
10.2 - Running-in It is advisable to execute a running-in of approximately 200 ÷ 400 h so that it is possible to achieve the maximum functionality.
The temperature of both gear reducer and lubricant may well rise beyond normal values during running-in. After the running-in period it may be necessary to verify the gear reducer fixing bolt tightness.
Size 63 64 80 81 100 125 140 160 smax 2 3 6 6 7 9 9 11 For sizes 63 ... 160, the hollow low speed shaft protection cap has to be keyed into seal ring seat that, for this reason, must be pushed towards gear reducer inside for the maximum depth stated in the table.
For this operation use the protection cap as a tool, hammering it carefully along the periphery (see fig. above). For ATEX design gear reducers, this accessory is not available.
9.9 - Hollow low speed shaft protection cap 44 Operating instructions G series UTD.187.2023.11.00_EN 11 - Maintenance 11.1 - General At machine rest, verify at regular intervals (more or less frequently according to environment and use): a) all external surfaces are clean and air passages to the gear reducer or gearmotor are free, in order that cooling remains fully effective; b) oil level and deterioration degree (check with cold gear reducer at rest); c) correct fastening screws tightening.
During the operation check: –  noise level; –  vibrations; –  sealings; –  etc.
Attention! After a running period, gear reducer is subject to a light internal overpressure which may cause burning liquid discharge. Therefore, before loosening whichever plug (filler plug included) wait until gear reducer has become cold and open it carefully; if not possible, take the necessary protection measures against burning due to warm oil contact. In all cases, always proceed with great care.
Maximum oil temperatures indicated on lubrication table do not represent a hindrance to the gear reducer regular running.
11.2 - Oil change Execute the operation at machine rest and cold gear reducer.
Pre-arrange a proper waste oil collection system, unscrew the drain plug and the filler plug in order to facilitate the draining; dispose the waste lubricant according to the laws in force.
Wash internally the gear reducer's housing using the same oil type applied during the running; the oil used for this washing can be re-used for further washings after filtering with 25 μm of filtration standard.
Fill the gear reducer again up to level.
During the oil change, it is necessary to replace the seal rings.
When dismounting the cap (whenever gear reducers are provided with), reset the sealing with adhesive on cleaned and degreased mating surfaces.
For lubrication intervals see table 6.2.
Apart from running hours: — replace mineral oil at least each 3 years; —  replace or regenerate synthetic oil each 5 - 8 years according to gear reducer size, running and environmental conditions.
Never mix different makes of synthetic oil; if oil-change involves switching to a type different from that used hitherto, then give the gear reducer a through clean-out.
11.3 - Coil and internal heat exchanger In case of long non-running periods at ambient temperatures lower than 0 °C, the coil or the internal heat exchanger on the inspection cover should be emptied out using compressed air to blast out all the coolant, so as to avoid freezing-up which would cause the coil to break.
Verify that there are no deposits inside the coil which may obstruct water circulation or affect cooling. If any, wash the coil with suitable chemical cleaning products or consult Rossi.
Check the internal heat exchanger periodically and, if necessary, clean the exchange surfaces taking care not to damage the finned surfaces.
11.4 - Seal rings It is always recommended that the seal rings are replaced with new ones when they are removed or during periodic checks of gear reducer; in this case, the new ring should be generously greased and positioned so that the seal line does not work on the same point of sliding contact as the previous ring.
Oil seals must be protected against heat radiation, also during the shrink fitting of parts, if applicable.
Duration depends on several factors such as dragging speed, temperature, ambient conditions, etc.; as a rough guide it can vary from 3150 to 25000 h.
In case of designs with labyrinth seal and greaser («Taconite»), re-grease every 3 000 h of running or every 6 months with grease KLÜBER STABURAGS NBU 8 EP (unless otherwise stated).

6) For R C3I 400 and 401: LWA = 92 and LpA = 80.
11.5 - Bearings Since there are many different types of bearings in a gear reducer (roller, tapered roller, straight roller, etc.) and each bearing works with different loads and speeds depending on the input speed, the nature of the load of the driven machine, the transmission ratio, etc., and with different lubricants (oil bath, oil splash, grease, oil circulation, etc.), it is not possible to define any periodical maintenance and replacement of bearings in advance.
If a precautionally maintenance is required, undertake periodical checks to verify noise level and vibration with the help of appropiate diagnostic equipment and instruments. If the measured values worsen even slightly it is necessary to stop gear reducer or gear motor and after having inspected inside the unit replace the bearings which are subject to breakdown.
11.6 - Metal filler plug with filter and valve When the gear reducer or gearmotor (size  100) is equipped with metal filler plug and valve (see fig. in order to clean it, it is necessary to unscrew it from the gear reducer (preventing any debris or other foreign items from entering the reducer, disassemble the cover, wash it with solvent, dry with compressed air and reassemble it). This operation is to be made according to environment conditions.
11.7 - Hollow low speed shaft In order to remove the hollow low speed shaft of the helical and bevel helical gear reducers (this is the first operation to perform when disassembling the gear reducer) turn the shaft until the keyway is facing the intermediate shaft as indicated in fig. 5 and push the shaft from the reference groove side (circumferencial keyway on shaft shoulder).
